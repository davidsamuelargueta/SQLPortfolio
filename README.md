Hello, here you will find the projects I am working on or have completed using MySQL. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my SQL skills by applying them on datasets from a variey of sources such as Kaggle and Maven Analytics. I would then take my analysis and create a visual with PowerBI as you can see in my PowerBI Reports Repository. Should you have any inquires or suggestions please feel free to contact me.
